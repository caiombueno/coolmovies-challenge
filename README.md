2. Tapping on a movie opens a view page presenting all the available information to the user.
3. Each movie page displays all its reviews.
4. Each review includes at least: title, body, and stars (1-5).
5. The user can create new reviews.
6. The user can see the reviews and movies even when offline.

You can see a demonstration of the sixth feature below:
